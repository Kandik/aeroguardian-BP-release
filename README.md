## Abstract

This bachelor's thesis aims to analyze the safety of the current integration of drones into the airspace with respect to surrounding traffic and proposes technical solutions to enhance the safety of this integration. It discusses how data is exchanged in aviation and suggests how a drone pilot could access such data to increase their awareness of surrounding air traffic. The thesis results in an application for planning and alerting that drone pilots can assess the safety of their planned flight, while also utilizing their own collected data. This application also warns them of suddenly arising threats during their flight. The resulting application was developed in a client-server architecture, maximizing its versatility and usability.
